# Starry Night Theme for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com)

> A dark theme inspired by Van Gogh's Starry Night for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com).

Embark on a visual journey through the enchanting hues of "Moonlit Reverie," a color palette meticulously crafted to capture the spirit of Vincent van Gogh's iconic masterpiece, "Starry Night." The deep, contemplative blues reminiscent of a midnight sky (#011627) lay the foundation, evoking the profound stillness and cosmic wonder that characterize the original artwork.

In "Moonlit Reverie," the foreground (#F6F6F6) breathes with a soft, ethereal glow, symbolizing the gentle dance of stars against the velvety canvas of the night. Delicate touches of cyan (#56B6C2) and green (#91B859) mirror the celestial harmony, while a hint of orange (#D18F4E) captures the warmth of distant constellations.

The palette unfolds like a poetic narrative, with the striking pink accents (#FF66B2) paying homage to the swirling nebulae that captivated van Gogh's imagination. Shades of purple (#A881D5) and red (#EF5350) echo the artist's fervent brushstrokes, revealing the emotional intensity embedded in the starry tapestry.

As the moonlight caresses the landscape, subtle yellow highlights (#FFC857) shimmer like distant galaxies, adding a touch of cosmic radiance to the composition. Darker tones of blue (#002137) and gray (#5C6773) gracefully interweave, mirroring the mysterious depths of the universe and drawing the viewer into a mesmerizing dreamscape.

"Moonlit Reverie" invites you to explore the intersection of art and emotion, a fusion of Van Gogh's timeless vision and a contemporary interpretation that echoes the cosmic beauty of "Starry Night." Immerse yourself in this celestial symphony, where each color tells a story, and the night sky becomes a canvas for the soul's deepest contemplations.
